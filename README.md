# automl-gs Examples

A repo of [automl-gs](https://github.com/minimaxir/automl-gs) examples trained on *real* datasets, along with performance visualizations.

Examples will be added over time!

*Note*: Because the full training results can be very large, the results in this repo only show the final epoch for each trial, and the repos will not contain the resulting model.

## Example Datasets

* `titanic`: The famous dataset used for prototyping ML models.
